free runner game idea
——
free runner sword play.
swipe directions to slash in directions
when running on ground, swipe down to slide
Environment: You could fly in the sky with clouds, or maybe go under water in slow motion, or you could dodge in narrow corridors, lots of fun fast paced possibilities. With lightning, lasers, birds perhaps, spaceships, fishies. Maybe a sky diver, or motorcycist, or some such?

now for the fun stuff…
—
tap to jump.
different paths to take in the level [platforming]
can tap on objects to interact with them depending on what you have equipped and what skills you have?
 - magnetic metal pieces to jump to them
 - aether pieces, teleport to them
 - laser pieces to shoot a laser towards them to ravage enemies in the path or perhaps obstacles?
	- could have escorts and you need to use the laser to clear a path for the escort.
 - points for the hell of it like super mario world
 - different paths lead to different exits for different levels.
 - also have coins like DKC to open secret world levels.
 - also have upgrades in different parts of the level
 - have checkpoints, and a player can start at any of the checkpoints in the level to make it easier to try and find secrets [without having to go through the entire level]
 - levels should be like a minute long. End levels maybe 2 minutes long. Very fast paced.
 - bosses generally just keep pace with you while running away, and you need to swing sword to protect your self or some interaction.
	- perhaps have a vertical boss that you have to keep hitting magnets to keep up with while slashing projectiles to not die.
